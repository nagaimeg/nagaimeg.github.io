Hello! My name is Meghan Nagai. I am starting my second year of college this semester, and like many others I am still figuring out what I want to be. Right now, my goal is to work in the market research field, which is why I started considering a double major in Management Information Systems and Marketing. I have always been interested in learning how to use technology efficiently and learning how to make it work for me. Majoring in MIS will teach me these useful skills and so much more.

From a young age, I have always enjoyed origami, mainly because it is so fulfilling to watch something 3D be build from a flat sheet of paper. Similarly, programming can be used to build databases, websites and more. For this reason, I am really looking forward to learning about programming this semester. I cannot wait to struggle through the learning process and create a beautiful pay off.
