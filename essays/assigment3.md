What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned?

 For this assignment, I was able to accomplish most of what I had planned. But if I had more time, I would have liked to format the invoice better so it fits with the theme.


Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?

In my assignment, I was not able to add a plus and minus to the cart and destroy the session upon logging out. There was also an issue with the extended price that I had difficulty resolving.
 
 
What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?

 My biggest challenge was deciding how I wanted to format my code. I kept on bouncing between two ideas which caused me to waste a lot of time developing multiple versions of semi-functioning code. In the end, I committed to a version after meeting with Professor Port. This was a major risk, but it allowed me to move forward with the assignment. 
 
 
What is your assessment of the overall quality of the system?

 Overall, I think my assignment is okay. The quality is not amazing, considering the invoice is not formatted to match the theme, but it is functioning. 
  
  
What is needed before this system can be placed into operation?

 Before my assignment can be placed into operation as an real business website, I believe that the session needs to be destroyed so that multiple users on one computer can order different products. Also a location to send their package would be helpful, additionally place to add and subtract a product from their cart would be good.
 
 
Describe what you are most proud of about this project:

 In this project, I am most proud of my product pages and cart. Although their layout is really simple, I really like how they turned out. 
 
 
Describe what you are least happy with this project:

 In this project, I am least happy with my template. It does not fit well with the theme of the website and appears very plain. I would definitely like to reformat it as well as fix the bug of not displaying the correct extended price for certain products.
 
 
Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. "I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization"):

I worked alone.
